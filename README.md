#Game of Life in JS

## Introduction

> Fullstack Academy workshop. The game of life is played on a 2D board (easily modeled as a 2D array), where each cell has two possible states: living or dead. For each iteration of the board state, the destiny of each cell is determined by these four rules:

## Conway's Game Of Life Rules

1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
2. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
